            I'm a full-stack developer with a passion for creating elegant solutions to complex problems. With expertise in both frontend and backend technologies, I build applications that are not only functional but also delightful to use.
          </p>
          <p>
            My journey in tech started with a curiosity about how things work. Over the years, I've worked with various technologies and teams, learning that great software comes from understanding user needs and writing maintainable code.

          <p>
            When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring new technologies, contributing to open source, or sharing knowledge with the community. I believe in lifelong learning and staying updated with industry trends.
